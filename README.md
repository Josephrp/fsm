# Factorio Server Manager

Factorio Server Manager (FSM) is a web-based application that allows you to manage a dedicated Factorio server with ease. It provides a reactive Vue 3 frontend and a Go backend to control server lifecycle, RCON commands, mod management, save games, server configuration, and version control — all from a modern browser interface.

## Configuration

FSM loads configuration from `fsm.ini`, searched in the following locations (in order):

1. Supplied `--config` argument
2. `./fsm.ini`
3. `~/.config/fsm/fsm.ini`
4. `/etc/fsm/fsm.ini`

### Example `fsm.ini`

```ini
[factorio]
saves           = ./data/saves
mods            = ./data/mods
logs            = ./data/logs
config          = ./data/config
downloads       = ./data/downloads
server_versions = ./data/servers

[rcon]
bind        = 127.0.0.1:27015
password    = secret

[server]
listen = :8080
```

## Docker

### Building

`docker build -t fsm .`

### Running

#### Initial setup


* Use the setup script `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarf-dev/fsm/refs/heads/main/setup-fsm.sh | bash`
* Edit docker-compose.yml if your port preferences are different
* Edit fsm.ini and change the RCon password the other settings shouldn't need to be changed and they can be changed in the UI.
* `docker compose up`
* On first run you will see the admin password which you can use to log in with
